    Welcome to the <bold>Virgo Observatory</bold> web pages. The Observatory is placed in 
    Seveso (Monza e Brianza) Italy under a sky strongly affected by the light pollution.
</p>

<p>
    In spite of the quality of the sky, the observatory is involved into a lot of research
    programs. In particular, the astrometry and photometry measurements of asteroids are realized 
    under the auspices of Division F of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
</p>

<p>
    Our Minor Planet Code nomination is M15, and our main efforts are dedicated to the NEO follow-up
    and forecast of asteroid occultations.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover the scientific activity, the observatory is also particular dedicated to the astro-imaging.
    We can reach an adequate sensitivity also on very faint objects using very narrow bands filter and using the HST
    palette with SII, H_alpha and OIII filters.
